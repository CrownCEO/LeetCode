/**
 * In a given array nums of positive integers, find three non-overlapping subarrays with maximum sum.

 Each subarray will be of size k, and we want to maximize the sum of all 3*k entries.

 Return the result as a list of indices representing the starting position of each interval (0-indexed). If there are multiple answers, return the lexicographically smallest one.
